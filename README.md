# PoCTextAdventureGame
Proof of Concept Text Adventure Game

# Background
I created this game to share with my daughter. 
The idea is that as she gets older we can build a world which she can explore.
Each week/day/month whatever works, we'll add new locations together.

I chose a text adventure game because (I hope) it will help with her reading and writing.

# Some Ideas
Rather than limit the user input to a limited number of text responses. I'm 
using the ChatGPT api to determine which possible action has been chosen.
Once I have the basics working, I want to extend the game to use AI generated
images based on the location describes.

# Requirements 



# Notes
Run 'pip install -e .' in the eves_game directory to get all the import working
correctly. 

If using VS code, checkout the launch.json file to setup VS Code Testing and 
the settings.json file for debug settings.
